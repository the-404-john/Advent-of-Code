# Advent-of-Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual, Christmas‑themed
programming event designed as an “Advent calendar” of small coding puzzles.
Participants of all skill levels solve the problems in the programming language
of their choice, earning “**stars**” and competing on both global and private
leaderboards.

People typically participate to
- improve or refresh their coding skills,
- compeate with peers,
- learn a new language,
- or just to have fun.

I love programming and love challanges :D. That’s why I had such a blast with
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Over the years I’ve participated in
multiple events. In this repo you’ll find some of earliest experiments in
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), alongside all the
[C23](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c.html) battle‑scars I racked up solving
those puzzles.

So… here are my solutions!
